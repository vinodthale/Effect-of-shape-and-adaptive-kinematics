# Effects of Reynolds Number and Thickness on Undulatory Self-Propelled Foil

This repository contains an IBAMR-based simulation of an undulatory self-propelled foil (eel-like swimmer) with **adaptive kinematics** based on Reynolds number and foil thickness. The implementation studies the hydrodynamic performance across different flow regimes and geometric configurations.

## ⚠️ Important: Two Separate Implementations

**This repository contains the ADAPTIVE kinematics research code** for exploring Reynolds number and thickness effects.

For **exact reproduction of Gupta et al. (2022)** with fixed parameters (Re=5000, St=0.6), see the separate validation suite:

- **Gupta, S., Sharma, A., Agrawal, A., Thompson, M. C., & Hourigan, K. (2022)**. "Anguilliform and carangiform fish-inspired hydrodynamic study for an undulating hydrofoil: Effect of shape and adaptive kinematics"

**Extensions in This Code** (beyond Zhang et al. 2018):
- Reynolds-dependent adaptive amplitude and frequency modulation
- Envelope power adaptation for anguilliform vs. carangiform modes
- Extended parameter study framework

### Key Features

1. **Reynolds Number Effects**: Simulates foil propulsion across different Reynolds numbers (Re = 1000 to 10000+)
2. **Thickness Variations**: Studies the effect of foil thickness ratio (h/L = 0.02 to 0.08+)
3. **Adaptive Kinematics**: Automatically adjusts swimming parameters (amplitude, frequency) based on Re and thickness
4. **Swimming Modes**: Supports anguilliform, carangiform, and intermediate swimming modes
5. **Performance Metrics**: Tracks thrust, power, swimming speed, and propulsive efficiency
6. **Shape Adaptation**: Models both slender (anguilliform) and thicker (carangiform) body shapes

## Physics and Implementation

### Adaptive Kinematics Model

The code implements Reynolds-dependent adaptive kinematics:

#### Amplitude Adaptation
```
A_adapted = A_base × f_Re(Re) × f_h(h/L)
```
- At **low Re** (Re < 5000): Amplitude increases due to viscous effects
- At **high Re** (Re > 5000): Amplitude decreases for better efficiency
- **Thicker foils** require larger amplitude to generate sufficient thrust

#### Frequency Adaptation
```
f_adapted = f_base × g_Re(Re) × g_h(h/L)
```
- At **low Re**: Frequency decreases (viscous damping)
- At **high Re**: Frequency can increase (inertial regime)
- **Thicker foils** undulate at lower frequencies

#### Envelope Power
The amplitude distribution along the body is controlled by:
```
A(s) = A_max × (s/L)^p
```
- **Anguilliform** (p ≈ 1): Linear amplitude increase
- **Carangiform** (p ≈ 2-3): Amplitude concentrated at tail

### Swimming Modes

| Mode | swimming_mode | Characteristics |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Anguilliform** | 0.0 - 0.3 | Whole-body undulation, thin foil |
| **Mixed** | 0.3 - 0.7 | Intermediate behavior |
| **Carangiform** | 0.7 - 1.0 | Posterior body undulation, thicker foil |

## Output and Analysis

### Simulation Outputs

Each simulation produces:

1. **Visualization Files** (in `viz_*/` directories)
   - Velocity fields, pressure, vorticity
   - Can be viewed with VisIt or ParaView

2. **Performance Metrics** (`performance_*.dat`)
   - Time-resolved thrust, power, speed, efficiency
   - Adapted amplitude and frequency
   - Strouhal number

3. **Structure Diagnostics** (in `Results_*/` directories)
   - Center of mass position and velocity
   - Drag, torque, power
   - Momentum components

### Analysis Tools

Analyze results using the provided Python script:

```bash
# Analyze all performance files in directory
python scripts/analyze_performance.py

# Analyze specific files
python scripts/analyze_performance.py performance_Re1000_h004.dat performance_Re10000_h008.dat
```

The script generates:
- **Time series plots**: Speed, thrust, power, efficiency vs. time
- **Kinematics plots**: Adapted amplitude and frequency evolution
- **Comparative plots**: Performance across different Re and h/L
- **Summary table**: Average performance metrics

### Key Performance Metrics

- **Swimming Speed**: Time-averaged forward velocity
- **Propulsive Efficiency**: η = (Thrust × Speed) / Power
- **Strouhal Number**: St = fA/U (optimal ≈ 0.2-0.4 for swimming)
- **Cost of Transport**: Power / (Speed × Weight)

## Expected Results

### Reynolds Number Effects

| Reynolds | Regime | Characteristics |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Re < 1000 | Viscous | Low speed, high power, low efficiency |
| Re ≈ 5000 | Transitional | Moderate performance, optimal for many fish |
| Re > 10000 | Inertial | Higher speed possible, better efficiency |

### Thickness Effects

| h/L | Swimming Mode | Characteristics |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|
| 0.02-0.04 | Anguilliform | High frequency, whole-body undulation |
| 0.04-0.06 | Mixed | Intermediate behavior |
| 0.06-0.08+ | Carangiform | Lower frequency, tail-focused propulsion |

### Adaptive Behavior

The code automatically adjusts kinematics based on Re and h/L:
- **Low Re + Thin foil**: Increases amplitude, decreases frequency
- **High Re + Thick foil**: Optimizes for efficiency, concentrates motion at tail
- **Intermediate cases**: Balances thrust generation and efficiency

## Physical Validation

The implementation includes several biologically-inspired features:

1. **Strouhal Number**: Adaptive kinematics target St ≈ 0.2-0.4, consistent with efficient swimmers
2. **Amplitude Envelope**: Matches observed fish kinematics (linear for anguilliform, polynomial for carangiform)
3. **Reynolds Scaling**: Follows empirical scaling laws from fish swimming studies
4. **Efficiency Trends**: Reproduces experimental observations of Re and thickness effects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Simulation crashes or becomes unstable**
